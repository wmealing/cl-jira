# cl-jira

## About

This is a common lisp library to query jira.  Its default is configured to query the Red Hat
Jira instance.

(setq cl-jira:*root-endpoint* "https://yourserver.com/rest/api/latest/")

There are a number of helper functions, they may be redhat specific.


This project is something that I'm working on to improve on the quality of my code along with
getting to better understand the common lisp ecosystem.
